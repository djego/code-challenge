# Code Challenge

## Why?

Code challenges are a fantastic way to figure out how you think and write code, with small, to-the-point projects.

## What?

You are going to to be creating a link shortener. This link shortener must:

1. Get a URL as an initial data.
2. Shorten it and return the shortened URL to the user.
3. Keep track of the shortened URL usage:
  1. Keep a counter on how many times the URL has been used.
  2. Record the IP address that called the URL, as well as the complete timestamp.
4. Provide a very simple interface to visualize the statistics of each shortened URL.

## How?

1. Fork this repository.
2. Work in the project.
3. When you are done, tag the source code as V1.0
4. Let me know that you have finished!

## With what?

1. Use any development language you want. Preferred are:
  1. Ruby
  2. Go
  3. PHP
  4. Python
  5. Java
  6. Javascript
2. Use any framework and tools you want, as long as you can commit the necessary files.

## Bonus points if you...

* Deploy your code to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* Provide good documentation
* Finish your project in 3 hours or less

## Last, but not least..

Good luck!
